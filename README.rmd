## File description

### R scripts
* **analysis.R**: This loads required packages and data.
* **analysis_diversity.R**: This analyses diversity indices for graminoid and forb species
* **analysis_cover.R**: This analyses cover of dominant and subordinate C~4~ and C~3~ graminoids, C~4~:C~3~ ratios and subordinate:dominant ratios.
* **analysis_C43r_soilNP.R**: This analyses relationship between C~4~:C~3~ ratios soil N and P availability using multiple regression analysis with annual soil moisture (Moist), understorey temperature (Temp) and photosynthetic active radiation(PAR).

### Data
* **graminoid_data.csv**: Cover data of graminoid species
* **forb_data.csv**: Cover data of forb species
* **env_data.csv**: Environmental variables (soil moisture, temperature and PAR)
* **soil_data.csv**: Plant accessible nutrients (ammonium, nitrate and phosphate)
* **graminoid_pfg.csv**: Table of graminoid species and corresponding plant functional types
* **metadata.csv**: Description of the variables in the data above
