## File description

### R scripts
* **analysis.R**: This loads required packages and data.
* **analysis_diversity.R**: This analyses diversity indices for graminoid and forb species
* **analysis_abundance.R**: This analyses cover abundance of *Microlaena stipoides* and *Cynodon dactylon* and total of C~3~ and C~4~ graminoids.
* **analysis_LAR.R**: This analyses log annual change ratio (LAR) of C~3~ (LAR~C3~) and C~4~ (LAR~C4~) using multiple regression with annual soil moisture (Moist), understorey temperature (Temp) and photosynthetic active radiation(PAR).
* **analysis_PRC.R**: This performs principal response curve analysis. The structure of permutation for repeated measurements of nested plots is also defined here.

### Data
* **graminoid_data.csv**: Cover abundance data of graminoid species
* **forb_data.csv**: Cover abundance data of forb species
* **env_data.csv**: Environmental variables (soil moisture, temperature and PAR)
* **graminoid_pfg.csv**: Table of graminoid species and corresponding plant functional types
* **metadata.csv**: Description of the variables in the data above
